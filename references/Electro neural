The ENVS provide a virtual perception of the three-dimensional proﬁle and colour of the surroundings throughelectrical pulses. 
The ENVS system comprises of a stereocamera which can capture the image and calculate the dis-parity depth map indicating
the distance to each point ofthe image. Special gloves with electrodes are used to de-liver the electrical pulses to the ﬁngers.
TranscutaneousElectro-Neural Stimulation unit in the ENVS system sam-ples the depth value from the computer and converts theminto an 
electro-neural pulse. Then these pulses are deliveredto the ﬁngers through electrodes in gloves. The intensity ofthe 
pulse varies with distance sampled corresponding to thedepth map region. Colors of the surroundings is determinedfrom the pulse frequency.
ENVS system enables a blind per-son to have a virtual experience by creating a mental mapof the 3D proﬁle of his/her surroundings.
