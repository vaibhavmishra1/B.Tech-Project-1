Virtual White CaneRoberto Manduchi and Dan Yuan [8, 9] developed a laser-based mobility device which make
use of the computer visiontechnology. The hand held device can be used as an alterna-tive to the traditional white cane used by the
blind peoplefor navigation. The user receives feedback about his/hersurrounding through a tactile interface and audio signals,
from which the blind person can make a mental image ofthe scene. Device scans surroundings with a laser pointerwhich is combined 
with a digital camera and a computerprocessor. The surroundings spacial information are gath-ered and analyzed as the user moves around.
The systemproduce special sounds for steps, curb or a drop oï¬€ thusmaking the navigation more comfortable.
